      <h1>Vianca built Unna as an escape</h1> 
      <p id="p1">Vianca's journey to open Vianca Resort has taken over two years, but she's not in a hurry, despite numerous inquiries flooding her DMs.</p>
      <p>"Ideally, we aim to open by 2023," she casually mentions, mindful of the resort's non-invasive construction, local sourcing, and impact on the Puro community. Embracing a sustainable approach, she reflects on the resort's creation: "We avoided big machinery and trucks, opting to build like a local."</p>
      <p>Roquero, an interior designer and photographer, shares a familiar tale of Millennial burnout and a quarter-life realization while working and traveling globally. Having excelled in her career in places like Dubai and Kenya, she hit a breaking point, questioning the grind culture and her chosen path. Graduating from the University of Santo Tomas with a prestigious Interior Design degree, she found solace in the idea of a simpler life, leading to the birth of her dream project, UNNA.</p>
      <p>She was overwhelmed with how and where to begin, so she decided that the best course of action was to search the Philippines' marble capital, Romblon province, for supplies. "Coming here wasn't my first option. "I fell in love with the province, but I came for the marble," she explains.</p>
      <p>She initially visited Romblon Island in her search for marble sources, staying at the retirement residence of a Filipina woman and her French spouse. In his prime, he was a qualified architect, but after retiring, he built straightforward homes out of the local kawayan (bamboo). Vianca exclaimed on the layout. She is aware that there could be an ingrained contempt for vernacular building among Filipinos. We tend to believe that it's difficult to sustain. She observed, "It's going to look cheap and get old soon," but she was drawn in by the retirement home's subtle Filipino design, which made use of sustainable materials. </p>
      <p>As fortune would have it, she was able to fulfill her modest childhood ambition of owning a home by the sea when she discovered a property on the nearby island of Puro. "Puro is the Tagalog word for pure. Because it makes me think of the old Philippines, I fell in love with the location. Very non-touristy. So untouched, still." She moved to Puro on the spur of the moment, relying on her own funds and her family's moral support.</p>
